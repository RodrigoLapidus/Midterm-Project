# Midterm-Project
Cloning of a website as a midterm project.

This includes a few pages:

    - home,
    - “project” page and
    - contact page with a form

Some of the challenges to complete are:

    - adding navigation between the pages
    - making all the fields in the contact form required before being able to submit it
